Spclust is also used in the process to find states. See ../README.md and ../Workflow.py

Running Spclust by itself
=========================
1. Compute the model. 
   For help:
     $ java -jar SpComputeModel.jar -h  
   Example:
     $ java -jar SpComputeModel.jar input-raw.txt 2 25 2 model.sp
     Note: 
     - There is actually 'input-raw.txt' (as an example input file) in the same directory as this README file.
     - The model is stored in 'model.sp'. You will need it later for step (2)

2. Compute the symbol (use the file 'model.sp' from step (1) above
   For help:
     $ java -jar SpComputeSymbols.jar -h
   Example: 
     $ java -jar SpComputeSymbols.jar model.sp testing-raw.txt sym.txt
     Note: 
     - There is actually 'testing-raw.txt' (as an example testing file) in the same directory as this README file.
     - The result is stored in sym.txt

3. (optional) Just in case you need to convert the symbolic file to domain of the original values. 
   Using example from step (2) above, this means converting 'sym.txt' to the domain of 'testing-raw.txt' and 'input-raw.txt'
   Note that this conversion is lossy.
   For help:
     $ java -jar SpGetRaw.jar -h
   Example:
     $ java -jar SpGetRaw.jar model.sp sym.txt raw-centroids.txt
   Note: 
     - File 'model.sp' is obtained from step (1)
     - File 'sym.txt' is obtained from step (2)
     - The result is stored in raw-centroids.txt
